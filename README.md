# compare-webpack-target-bundles
Example of webpack targets bundled into separate bundles.

## Overview

This repo is a super small playground for testing and learning how webpack output "templates" (shape of the bundle), vary between build targets. 
Feel free to use this as you will. Can also serve a purpose for bug reporting. 

## Usage

Clone the repo locally, `cd` into repo and run the following: 

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

**Resulting bundles can be seen in the `dist` folder**

## Thats IT!
